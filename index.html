<h1>The Colorado Family Farm</h1>

<h3>Locally Owned, Locally Produced Solar Energy Farm</h3>
<h3>Focusing on Research, Education, Pollinators &amp; Art</h3>

<div id="center-text" style="font-size: 110%">
  <p>We are excited to announce our plans to build a community solar
    garden in Boulder County. Our vision is to farm more than just
    solar energy – we’re also continuing the legacy my grandfather
    started when he began farming our land more than 45 years
    ago. We’re building a community-based, socially responsible
    enterprise that will supply locally produced energy to our Front
    Range neighbors, host a one-acre pollinator habitat, partner with
    research institutions to study crop growth under solar panels, and
    provide educational opportunities to our youth.</p>

  <p>Sign up below to learn more about joining our community-based
    solar program or to keep up with farm projects and developments.</p>

  <p>Thank you for your interest and support.</p>
